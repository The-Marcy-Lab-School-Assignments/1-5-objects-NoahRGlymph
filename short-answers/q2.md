# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
When you pass by value, a copy of the actual value is passed to the function. When you pass by reference, a reference to the original value is passed to the function. pass by reference has mutable behavior; changes inside the function affect the original value.
