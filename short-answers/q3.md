# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
A shallow clone is a copy of an object or an array where only the top-level structure is duplicated, while the cloned object or array shares references to the same nested objects or arrays as the original object or array.

It can cause bugs because when dealing with nested arrays/objects shadow cloning only copies segments of the nested code. This can lead to data inconsistencies and unexpected side effects/bugs when dealing with complex nested data structures.
